        In the mid-1990s, the high-energy physics community (think FermiLab and CERN) started planning for the Large Hadron Collider.  Managing the petabytes of data that would be generated by the facility and sharing it with the globally distributed community of over 10,000 researchers would be a major infrastructure and technology problem.  This same community that brought us the web has now developed standards, software, and infrastructure for grid computing.  In this seminar I'll present some of the exciting science that is being done on the Open Science Grid, the US national cyberinfrastructure linking 60 institutions (Harvard included) into a massive distributed computing and data processing system.

        Most coding interviews are like another coding competition. I would like to start by talking about resources like Project Euler, Poj, USACO, Codeforces, Topcoder. Then I will move into the broad topics that everyone needs to know to answer simple questions. Finally, I will end with a hands-on period where we will try some problems and go over some problems that I have personally seen and find very interesting.

        This seminar will discuss the basics of Java, including methods, constructors, private vs. public variables, and some &quot;equivalents&quot; of C in Java. Java is, in some cases, easier to use than C (strings are native to Java, for example), so it might be useful to some students working on specific projects.

        There's an ongoing geospatial revolution happening right now. Unfortunately, despite the rapid rise of geospatial technologies, here at Harvard there are few if any courses that focus on Geographic Information Science.  I propose to lead a brief seminar that introduces the basics of GIScience and hopes to inspire students to generate exciting new spatially aware mobile applications that pick up where popular location-based services such as Google Maps and Yelp leave off.  Since a large percentage of &quot;apps&quot; have a spatial component, this topic should be of interest to students looking to design new mobile computing software.

        Thomas Edison is credited with saying that invention is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration. Getting an innovative solution from the lab (or the garage) into a real production environment can be an arduous process. But until something delivers real value in a real-world environment, it's just a novelty.  Here are some things to consider.
